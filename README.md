### My Fedora Rawhide Setup
In this dotfiles you will find my niri configuration, noctalia-shell,  fastfetch and more.

What i did to setup fedora rawhide + nix :

firstly I enabled terra repo and installed niri
```
git clone https://github.com/RoudineBWT/fedora-dotfiles.git
cd fedora-dotfiles
sudo bash fedora-install.sh
```
secondly I installed nix and home manager via this *nix-installer.sh*
```
sudo bash nix-install.sh
```
